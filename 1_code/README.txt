##Overview
This project is a web-based application that allows users to add, view, and delete different types of media (books, movies, music). All media entries are saved locally in the browser using localStorage, so no server is required.

## Prerequisites
1. Modern web browser
2. Internet access is not required (runs offline after downloading the files)

## Running the File
1. Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).
2. The homepage will appear with a navigation menu and options to add or view media.
3. You can:
 - Add new media by filling out the form.
 - View all media entries.
 - Delete any media entry you no longer want.
4. All data will be saved automatically in your browser's local storage.

No additional installation is required.

##Notes
- Data is stored only locally. Clearing browser storage will erase the saved media.
- No external libraries or frameworks are used.
