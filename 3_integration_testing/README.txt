# Integration Testing Guide

## Overview
This folder contains integration tests for testing interactions between subsystems.


To run the tests:
1. Ensure you have PHPUnit installed on your system.
2. Configure any dependencies (e.g., database server) before running the tests.
3. Run the integration tests by running `integration_test.php`.


Integration tests cover:
* Full system workflow
* Database interaction and data integrity
